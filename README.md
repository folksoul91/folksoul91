# Hi thereðŸ‘‹, I'm Dane - a husband, friend, and your developer dude!

![alt text](./image/Dane%20Kim%20Github%20Header.png)

I am full stack developer looking to build stuff. Do you need help building a cool web application but don't know where to begin? I'd love to help! I pride myself in these three categories:

- Communication - everyone can code but not everyone can listen to your needs.
- Honesty - I'm going to be very upfront about how to best approach in completing your projects
- Best practices - to avoid bugs in your code staying up to date on current best code practices is a must!

I have a background in chemistry/chemical engineering which helped me transitioned to development with the mindset of I can problem solving anything.
